This is not just a boring licence file, but important instructions!
PLEASE READ THESE BRIEF INSTRUCTIONS !!!

This package is an updating system for LangTran,
the Language and Translation software distribution system.
LangTran makes it easy for you to get the latest updates to useful programs 
and keep them in /usr/local/langtran on your own computer,
so you will have them with you when you are away from any fast 
internet connection.

As part of the installation, edit the list of Groups that you can get 
and remove the hash character (#) before any Groups that you want to get. 

Whenever you have a good internet connection, run this software 
and it will get any new versions of all the files you want 
and copy them to your local folder, removing any old versions.

This is free software, (see "LICENSE.txt") and by using the software you agree
that you will take full responsibility for its use.
