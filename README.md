## LangTran Updade method for Mac OS X
These scripts depend on _rsync_ to keep a software repository on your local computer up-to-date, and in sync with the international repository of the [LangTran Software Distribution System](http://lingtransoft.info/apps/langtran).

The tree of files is wrapped up in a _.pkg_ file inside a _.dmg_ file for the Mac OS X platform.

The package can be installed to provide a working version, but there are no good icons to click on yet.
